-- COMMENTS ARE ALWAYS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY HELP THE READER (CODE EXECUTER) WHAT HE NEEDS TO DO OR PAY ATTANTION

-- FIRST RULE - ALWAYS STATE IN THE BEGINNING WHAT THE READER (CODE EXECUTER) WILL NEED TO CHANGE 
-- REMEBER TO DO IT IN THE EXACT ORDER OF THE CODE
	
	-- 1ยบ: Never forget to update all the dates of this code.

-- 1.2. Performing a left join so I can getinformationg from other another datase

			group by code_id, category_lvl2
			order by code_id, category_lvl2)
			as b on a.code_id=b.code_id and a.category_lvl2=b.category_lvl2;
			

			
-- You can  do this with different databases and then join them with a union all:

create table server.anotherdatabase2 as select
